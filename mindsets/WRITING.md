# WRITING

## Style

- Short, direct sentences
- Remove words that don't change meaning
- Concrete facts over vibes
- Each paragraph carries load
- **Never announce things or things about things — simply state things**

Examples:
- ❌ "cn-agent is serious infrastructure. It assumes:"
- ✅ "cn-agent expects:"
- ❌ "This document describes the protocol"
- ✅ [just describe the protocol]

## Claims

Only state what you can tie to:
- Observed behavior in this runtime
- Code/scripts in this repo
- Named external sources

## Platform

| Platform | Rules |
|----------|-------|
| Discord/WhatsApp | No markdown tables, use bullets |
| Discord links | Wrap in `<>` to suppress embeds |
| WhatsApp | No headers, use **bold** or CAPS |

## Voice

Use TTS for stories and summaries when available.
