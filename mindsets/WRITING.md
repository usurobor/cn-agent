# WRITING

## Core Principle

**Coherent writing: nothing can be removed without loss.**

If a word, sentence, or paragraph can be cut without reducing understanding — cut it.

## Coherence at Each Level

### Words

Remove what doesn't change meaning.

- ❌ "In order to configure the settings"
- ✅ "To configure settings"

### Sentences

Direct path to meaning. No preamble.

- ❌ "It is important to note that the system requires authentication"
- ✅ "The system requires authentication"

- ❌ "This section describes how X works"
- ✅ "X works by..."

### Content

Concrete and sourceable. Vibes don't survive scrutiny.

- ❌ "This approach is more elegant"
- ✅ "This approach uses 3 fewer lines"

- ❌ "This is the best approach"
- ✅ "This approach is used by Linux, Git, and Postgres"

### Structure

Each paragraph moves understanding forward.

- ❌ Restating what was just said
- ✅ New fact, new angle, or new consequence
